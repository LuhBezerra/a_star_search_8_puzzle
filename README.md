# 8-Puzzle Solver Project

## Project Overview

This project implements an A* search algorithm to solve the 8-puzzle game. The 8-puzzle consists of a 3x3 grid with tiles numbered from 1 to 8 and one empty space. The objective is to move the tiles around until the game reaches a specified goal state from a given initial state. The solution uses the Manhattan distance as a heuristic to estimate the cost of the remaining moves to reach the goal state.
